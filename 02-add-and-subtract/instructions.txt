Goal: Make two buttons that will update a number in the DOM

STEP 1:
- In your HTML, create a new <div>
- This <div> should contain three elements:
--- One button that contains the text: "-1"
--- A header-2 element that contains the number: 0
--- A second button that contains the text: "+1"

STEP 2:
- Center the <div>
- Line up the first button, header-2, and the second button horizontally
--- Use Flexbox or Grid, your choice

STEP 3:
- Style your buttons with:
--- A different background color
--- A different font color
--- Add rounded corners
--- Increase the size of the font

- Any other styling is your choice

STEP 4:
- In your JavaScript file, add event listeners for the two buttons
- In the event that button "-1" is clicked:
--- Create a function that will update the header-2 element to subtract the current number by 1
- In the event that button "+1" is clicked:
--- Create a function that will update the header-2 element to add the current number by 1
