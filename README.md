<br>

### The "video-demo.webm" file provides a short video showing the finished project

- while some styling is instructed, colors are completely up to you

### The "solution" folder contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files if you get stuck  
- reference these only after exhausting all other resources

<br>

### The goal is to learn how to problem solve on simple projects for new developers  
- Use your search engine of choice
- Utilize online sites such as MDN, CSS Tricks, Stack Overflow, and more
